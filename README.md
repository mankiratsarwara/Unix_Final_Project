# Unix_Final_Project

We created a website using Jekyll in Linux. We chose the Cayman theme instead of the basic Minima theme that is set as default to make our site look better. Other than the website we made together, we each made a website on our own and linked it to the joined website we made. For our separate websites, we used simple HTML and CSS.

Here are the subjects about all three websites:

- Mankirat and Christian's website: A mini-blog on hip-hop and hip-hop artists

- Christian's website: Top 5 season leaders of the season 2020-2021, as of April 10th

- Mankirat's website: Fights Central, a website on the week's featured fighters


We also have a script made bash (.sh) that, when executed, pulls if there are new changes from our repository. To make the process efficient, we made .service file that executes the script in the background every 5 minutes using .timer file. Both systemd files are in /etc/systemd/system/ , but we made a copy of our services, to show how they look like.
