                    Our Ratings/Thoughts on the Artist.

Mankirat: In my eyes, Jay-Z is the greatest rapper of all-time. His story telling and grimey bars really set the standard for generations of rappers. His discography is filled with classics with hits on tracks with stars like Kanye West, Alicia Keys, Rihanna and more! He has done everything in the rap game and then some: commercial success, world tours, accolades, etc. Today, he is a businessman with his ventures garnering him over a $1 Billion in net worth.
