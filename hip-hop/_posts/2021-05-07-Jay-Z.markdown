<h1 align="center">Our Thoughts on the artist.</h1>

Mankirat: In my eyes, Jay-Z is the greatest rapper of all-time. His story telling and grimey bars really set the standard for generations of rappers. His discography is filled with classics with hits on tracks with stars like Kanye West, Alicia Keys, Rihanna and more! He has done everything in the rap game and then some: commercial success, world tours, accolades, etc. Today, he is a businessman with his ventures garnering him over a $1 Billion in net worth.

Christian: I only started getting into Jay-Z's discography a couple of years ago. When I was younger, I only hear a few of his mainstream songs, such as "Empire State Of Mind", and his features on some of Kanye's albums. I always wanted to deeply get into his music because I heard many good things about his music. I tried looking on Youtube, and even on some illegal streaming services (I was young with no money), but the only way to have to listen to his full discography, you would have to download his streaming service, Tidal. I didn't end up purchasing a membership to Tidal, however, a couple of years later, Jay-Z finally released his music on Apple Music. Today, I listened to most of his albums and fell in love with each of them. Jay-Z's storytelling as well as his flow, rhymes, and beats is an art to my ears. This rapper's come up, starting his career at the age of 26, coming from the Marcy Projects, and today being a billionaire and an entrepreneur, as well as a top rapper of all time amazes me.
