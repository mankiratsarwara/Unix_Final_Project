<h1 align="center">Our Thoughts on the artist.</h1>

Mankirat: J. Cole is my favourite artist. I first heard of him when I stumbled across his hit album 2014 Forest Hills Drive in high school. This was the time when I was getting into hip-hop. His beats and lyrical ability really set himself apart from the competition. I mostly liked how relatable his bars are and the content of his music which is mostly not materialistic compared to the current rap scene.

Christian: J. Cole is one of the few artists that are humble and speak from his heart. He makes me realize he is no different than me. The rapper does not forget his humbling beginnings when he is rapping. Because of that, I could relate to him, which makes me appreciate him more. Additionally, the sound of his music always evolved. As the era of rap has evolved, the use of trap beats and autotune in rapper's songs became more popular. Jermaine Cole didn't shy away from experimenting with trap beats, as he featured with some of those artists, and even incorporated the sounds in his latest songs. He comes down to one of my favorite artists. Cole is one of the few artist that have a bad song. I could only recall of one or two songs that were not my cup of tea. Right now, Cole has an upcoming album, coming on the 14th of May, and I can't wait to get a hold of it.
