                                Mini-Biography

Bashar Barakah Jackson was born on July 20, 1999 in Brooklyn, New York. Contrary to the other rappers on this blog, Pop Smoke only started his musical career at the end of 2018. The main contributing factors to his rise to fame are his unusual deep voice and the commercial success of his two mixtapes. He is widely considered to be the face of Brooklyn Drill music. Sadly, Pop Smoke passed away by gunshot wounds at the age of 20 at his Hollywood Hills home.

                    Our Ratings/Thoughts on the Artist.

Mankirat: First I heard of Pop Smoke was when my friends told me about him when his first mixtape dropped. I brushed it off and said I'll give him a listen eventually. The day that he passed away, I truly gave his discography a listen and I regretted not listening to him earlier. His voice and versatility really made him different from other drill/trap artists and really got me into drill rap. Today, I still listen to him and listen to a lot more drill thanks to his music introducing me to the genre.

Christian: The first time I listened to Pop Smoke I obviously noticed his deep voice. His voice is what seperated him from other artists. If I ever need energy, I could always listen to one of his songs, and I will be hyped for the rest of the day. But that's all could Pop Smoke could do. But that's what I thought before his posthumous album was dropped. The artist proved to me that he could rap over other beats than drill beats. Some of his songs in his latest album shows emotion and love. The late rapper had a great future ahead of him. He had a lot of potential, being the great artist he was. Sometimes I think of the addionnal songs he could have done if he had brutally shot. Rest In Peace.
