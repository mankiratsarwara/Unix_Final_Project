                    Our Ratings/Thoughts on the Artist.

Mankirat:

Christian: I am not a heavy listener of Lil Baby, but one day I'll try to dive into his albums and mixtapes heavily to explore more. Hearing his music inside parties or simply when I go on car rides with the boys, I always end up being hyped after listening. I do not have a lot to say on Lil Baby, as I still have amateur knowledge of his songs, but from what I heard, I could see why he is liked by many.
