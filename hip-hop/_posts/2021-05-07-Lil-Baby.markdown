                    Our Ratings/Thoughts on the Artist.

Mankirat: Now this is a funny one, initially, I did not like Lil Baby. The reason why is becasue I was in a stage in my life where I only listened to conscious/lyrical rap. Once I started getting more into trap and drill, Lil Baby's discography got more appealing to me. Since he's arival in the trap scene, all his projects have done numbers and have really cemented his spot as a top trap artist today.

Christian: I am not a heavy listener of Lil Baby, but one day I'll try to dive into his albums and mixtapes heavily to explore more. Hearing his music inside parties or simply when I go on car rides with the boys, I always end up being hyped after listening. I do not have a lot to say on Lil Baby, as I still have amateur knowledge of his songs, but from what I heard, I could see why he is liked by many.
