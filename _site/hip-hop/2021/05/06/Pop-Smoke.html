</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Bashar Barakah Jackson was born on July 20, 1999 in Brooklyn, New York. Contrary to the other rappers on this blog, Pop Smoke only started his musical career at the end of 2018. The main contributing factors to his rise to fame are his unusual deep voice and the commercial success of his two mixtapes. He is widely considered to be the face of Brooklyn Drill music. Sadly, Pop Smoke passed away by gunshot wounds at the age of 20 at his Hollywood Hills home.</p>
